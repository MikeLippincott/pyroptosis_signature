# Download data for wave 3: Cell Painting Assay + Gasdermin-D channel

In this module, we will provide instructions to download the wave 3 data for the Interstellar project.
This wave 3 data is a full Cell Painting Assay with the addition of a 6th channel for Gasdermin-D consisting of 17,280 images.

The stains and channels for this wave are as follows:

- HOECHST 33342 -> Nuclei
- PhenoVue Fluor 488 -> Concanavalin A/Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
- WGA555/Phalloidin568 -> Plasma membrane (PM) and Glogi/Actin
- CP_Nuclei acid_512-> RNA
- Mito_641_narrow -> Mitochondria
- Alexa 700_narrow -> Abcam Gasdermin Ab
